This project represents implementing tensor-train decomposition algorithms for solving motion optimal control problem.

When a problem is high-dimensional or involves a state space that is defined by several variables, various methods used to solve pursuit evasion games often require unrealistic computation time. This problem, called the curse of dimensionality, can be mitigated under certain circumstances by utilizing tensor-train (TT) decomposition.

We implemented two different approaches for solving the problem:
* Value Iteration algorithm
* Tensor-Train based Value Iteration algorithm
